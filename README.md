# Chirp

Following along with Chris McCord's Phoenix demo video [Build a real-time Twitter clone in 15 minutes with LiveView and Phoenix 1.5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZvmYaFkNJI&t=359s)

Some differences will be present because I'm using Phoenix 1.7 instead of 1.5, and also because I might experiment and play around.
